# Notes on LaTeX

> Because LaTeX was designed as a typesetting program, PDF documents created using LaTeX do not include the document structure and tagging required for accessibility by default. It is possible to create accessible PDF documents using LaTeX but users will need to use additional LaTeX packages and should be aware of accessibility standards. The Accessibilty package in LaTeX can be used to add the structure, tagging, and alt text that PDF's created with LaTeX lack.

The support of tagged PDF within \LaTeX is ongoing. It appears that as of June 2023, the most upto date instructions would be:

1. \LaTeX is run with the testphase=phase-III and testphase=math extensions

2. Only base packages (`article`, `report`, `book`) are supported (not `amsart`?)

3. `LuaTeX` is used as the front end rather than `pdflatex`

It seems like the `tagpdf` package (mentioned below) is no longer needed for this to work.

## Untested

The above recipe is untested. Confirmation of it working would be welcome.

## Packages

## These may all be outdated

:::

* [tagpdf](https://ctan.org/pkg/tagpdf?lang=en)


The package offers tools to experiment with tagging and accessibility using pdfLATEX and LuaTEX. It isn’t meant for production but allows the user to try out how difficult it is to tag some structures; to try out how much tagging is really needed; to test what else is needed so that a pdf works e.g. with a screen reader. Its goal is to get a feeling for what has to be done, which kernel changes are needed, how packages should be adapted.

::: {.callout-note}
## Actively developed

This package is actively developed
:::

* [accessibility](https://ctan.org/pkg/accessibility?lang=en)

The accessibility package is intended to create tagged, structured PDF documents from LATEX source code. It allows to produce tagged PDF output following Adobe’s PDF-1.5 and 1.6 specifications.

::: {.callout-note}
## Wait!

As of 2020 the author discourages the use of this package.

:::


* [axessiblity](https://ctan.org/pkg/axessibility?lang=en)

PDF documents containing formulas generated by LATEX are usually not accessible by assistive technologies for visually impaired people and people with special educational needs (i.e., by screen readers and braille displays). The axessibility package manages this issue, allowing to create a PDF document where the formulas are read by these assistive technologies, since it automatically generates hidden comments in the PDF document (by means of the /ActualText attribute and/or suitable tags) in correspondence to each formula.
