# ADA and the Math Department

The Department of Mathematics takes seriously compliance with the requirements of the [ADA](https://www.ada.gov/).


In spring of 2023, CUNY entered into an [voluntary agreement](https://www.justice.gov/usao-sdny/pr/us-attorney-announces-agreement-city-university-new-york-remedy-exclusion-student) with the Southern District of New York. This was in response to a student complaint in 2011 that WebAssign was not accessible given their needs. ("That digital platform was not fully capable of reading out mathematical and scientific symbols and equations.")

Part of the settlement included:

* The prompt availability of accessible course materials by the start of the relevant course or as soon as practicable based upon early consultations with affected students;

* nformation Technology accessibility consistent with the latest Web Content Accessibility Guidelines, including via verification of the accessibility of third-party learning products and of instructorsâ€™ awareness of accessibility requirements for instructor-created content;

This page attempts to make aware the  accessibility requirements for instructor-created content, as commonly done in a mathematics class.

## The technology stack

Math classes at CSI use several different technology stacks. For online homework we use all of WebAssign, Achieve, and WeBWorK.

To generate course materials, many instructors use LaTeX to create pdf, many use a markdown variant and Quarto to generate pdf and HTML pages, others use Microsoft Word, and still others have their own solutions.

These pages contain working notes on each of these.
