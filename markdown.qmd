# Notes on Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight markup language for creating formatted text using a plain-text editor.  ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown))

Markdown is standardized by [CommonMark](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown#Standardization) but there are many variants.

## Quarto

One variant is the Markdown supported in [Quarto](https://quarto.org), which is well described on its webpages. Quarto uses pandoc to handle conversions and can output to the three main formats discussed here: PDF, HTML, and MS Word.

We copy a few pieces of the documentation below:

### Figures

[Figures](https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/figures.html) are created with the syntax:

```verbatim
![caption](elephant.png){fig-alt="A drawing of an elephant."}
```

Which contains the image a caption and an alt tag for screen readers. Many other options are also available for sizing and alignment.

An alternate syntax that can be used to wrap, say, generated figures is to use the `div`-block constructs:

```verbatim
::: {#fig-label layout-ncol=2}

... figure code, e.g. ![sub-caption](link){fig-alt="alt tab"} ...

Main caption
:::
```

## Tables

[Tables](https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/tables.html) can be created in a fairly simple manner with "pipe tables". The example from the documentation:

::: {layout-ncol="2"}

:::: {}

``` markdown
| Default | Left | Right | Center |
|---------|:-----|------:|:------:|
| 12      | 12   |    12 |   12   |
| 123     | 123  |   123 |  123   |
| 1       | 1    |     1 |   1    |

```

::::

:::: {}

| Default | Left | Right | Center |
|---------|:-----|------:|:------:|
| 12      | 12   |    12 |   12   |
| 123     | 123  |   123 |  123   |
| 1       | 1    |     1 |   1    |

Tables may also be generated programattically.

### Equations

Quarto provides support for [Technical writing](https://quarto.org/docs/visual-editor/technical.html) including equations, citations, cross-references, footnotes, embedded code, and LateX.

LaTeX equations are authored using standard Pandoc markdown syntax, which uses matching dollar signs (one or two) to indicate inline and display math.

### Embedded code

Quarto makes the mix of executable computer code with text quite effortless, allowing for reproducible, dynamic documents.

The embedded code can have labels, captions, alt tags, etc.

Embedded code can also have [annotations](https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/code-annotation.html).
