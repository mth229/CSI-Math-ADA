This was in response to a student complaint in 2011 that WebAssign was not accessible given their needs. (“That digital platform was not fully capable of reading out mathematical and scientific symbols and equations.”)\nPart of the settlement included:\nThis page attempts to make aware the accessibility requirements for instructor-created content, as commonly done in a mathematics class."
