This was in response to a student complaint in 2011 that WebAssign was not accessible given their needs. (“That digital platform was not fully capable of reading out mathematical and scientific symbols and equations.”)\nPart of the settlement included:\nThis page attempts to make aware the accessibility requirements for instructor-created content, as commonly done in a mathematics class."

For online homework we use all of WebAssign, Achieve, and WeBWorK.\nTo generate course materials, many instructors use LaTeX to create pdf, many use a markdown variant and Quarto to generate pdf and HTML pages, others use Microsoft Word, and still others have their own solutions.\nThese pages contain working notes on each of these."

A key feature is easy integration with programming languages like Julia, R, and Python.\n\nOne issue I’m running into now is Quarto isn’t able to produce tagged PDF/A documents. At least not with what I tried which is just\n(it doesn’t understand how Quarto’s tables are produced and isn’t able to compile).\nQuarto is built on Pandoc which then uses pdflatex so the accessibility information needs to be passed through multiple levels. Pandoc has more info at 1 and 2. The suggestion with Pandoc is to use ConTeXt instead of LaTeX since ConTeXt always produces tagged documents, although Pandoc requires an extension in order to optimize for tagging.\nSummary: Quarto is not suitable for producing tagged PDFs at this time; the best workaround I can find is to use html output. The main drawback is figures in tikz need to be compiled separately."
