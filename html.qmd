# Notes on HTML/CSS

Adapted from the W3C's [Easy Checks][1] and CUNY [Guidance][3].

## Guidance:

* Page title (`<title></title>`)
    * should adequately and briefly describe the content of the page
    * should be different from other pages on the same website
* Image alternative text (alt-text) (`<img alt="..."`)
    * Every functional image (e.g. figures) should have a descriptive alt-text
    * Decorative image which do not need description, should have a null alt-text (`alt=""`)
* Text
    * Use semantic headings (`<h1>`, `<h2>`,...) rather than `<div>` or `<span>`
    * Aim for good contrast between different colors (7:1). Larger text is allowed to have a slightly lower contrast ratio (4.5:1). Test this with tools such as [from WebAIM][5] or Mozilla Firefox's accessibility dev tools (<kbd>F12</kbd>).
    * Text should resize well. Test zooming in to 200%.
* Structure
    * Use [semantic tags][4] (e.g. `<header>`, `<main>`, `<section>`) where possible, rather than `<div>`. Likewise, prefer `<em>` and `<strong>` rather than `<i>`, `<b>` or `<span>`.
* Interactivity
    * Tabbing order (<kbd>tab</kbd>) for links should be visible and follow a logical order through the page
